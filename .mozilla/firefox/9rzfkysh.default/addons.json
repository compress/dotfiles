It has similar key bindings and you could call it a modal web browser, as key bindings differ according to which mode you are in. For example, it has a special Hint mode, where you can follow links easily with the keyboard only. Also most functionality is available as commands, typing :back will go back within the current page history, just like hitting the back button in the toolbar.\n\nBut Vimperator is more than just a simple command interface to Firefox — it is a complete development environment as well. If you are a web developer, you can enjoy an interactive JavaScript shell — even with completion support. Or if you want to extend Vimperator, you can easily do that by just dropping a JavaScript file in its plugin directory.\n\nVimperator was initially written by Martin Stubenschrott but has found many other contributors in the meanwhile.\n\n=== Features ===\n\n* Vim-like keybindings (h, j, k, l, gg, G, 0, $, ZZ, , etc.)\n* Ex commands (:quit, :open www.foo.com, ...)\n* Tab completion available for all commands with support for 'longest' matching when set in 'wildmode'\n* Extensions! Yes, you can extend Vimperator's functionality with scripts just like you can extend Firefox with extensions.\n* Explore JavaScript objects with :echo window and even context-sensitive tab completion.\n* Hit-a-hint like navigation of links (start with f to follow a link)\n* Advanced completion of bookmark and history URLs (searching also in title, not only URL)\n* Vim-like statusline with a wget-like progress bar\n* Minimal GUI (easily hide useless menubar and toolbar with :set guioptions=)\n* Ability to :source JavaScript files, and to use a ~/.vimperatorrc file\n* Easy quick searches (:open foo will search for \"foo\" in google, :open ebay terminator will search for \"terminator\" on ebay) with support for Firefox keyword bookmarks and search engines\n* Count supported for many commands (3 will go back 3 pages)\n* Beep on errors\n* Marks support (ma to set mark 'a' on a webpage, 'a to go there)\n* QuickMarks support (quickly go to previously marked web pages with go{a-zA-Z0-9})\n* :map and :command support (and feedkeys() for script writers)\n* :time support for profiling\n* Move the text cursor and select text with vim keys and a visual mode.\n* External editor support\n* Macros to replay key strokes\n* AutoCommands to execute action on certain events\n* A comprehensive :help, explaining all commands, mappings and options.\n* Much more...","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/58/58919.png?src=api&modified=1307310916","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/58/58919.png?src=api&modified=1307310916","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Hints allow to follow links with the keyboard"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/58/58920.png?src=api&modified=1307310916","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/58/58920.png?src=api&modified=1307310916","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Vimperator's completion system"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/58/58921.png?src=api&modified=1307310916","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/58/58921.png?src=api&modified=1307310916","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Exploring the DOM of the web page"}],"homepageURL":"http://www.vimperator.org/","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/?src=api","supportURL":"http://www.vimperator.org","contributionURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/developers?src=api","contributionAmount":"$10.00","averageRating":5,"reviewCount":150,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":567868,"weeklyDownloads":1797,"dailyUsers":28740,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/243918/vimperator-3.8.2-fx.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":596234,"updateDate":1392540439000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"tabscope@xuldev.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/addon_icons/4/4882-32.png?modified=1374279374","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/addon_icons/4/4882-64.png?modified=1374279374"},"type":"extension","name":"Tab Scope","version":"1.5","creator":{"name":"Gomita","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/gomita/?src=api"},"description":"Preview and navigate tab contents through popup.","fullDescription":"Shows a popup on tabs and enables you to preview and navigate tab contents through popup.
